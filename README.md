An Offline Chat App
I named it "Nearby Chat"
App Idea: It works without an internet connection. Just turn on your location, open the app, press the search icon, and it will show you people near you who also have the app open. Then, you can chat with them.
App Range:
First: Actual Connection Range

Technology TypeApproximate RangeDetailsBluetooth5 to 10 metersUsed for the initial search for nearby devices. Excellent for initiating the connection.Wi-Fi Direct (P2P)30 to 100 metersAfter establishing the connection, data transfers via Wi-Fi Direct at high speed. This is the mode used for sending photos and large files.UltrasoundLess than 2 metersSometimes used for super-accurate proximity detection or to confirm connection without Wi-Fi.
Actual Performance in Reality
Between two phones in the same room or house → Connection is excellent and very fast (like Apple's AirDrop).
Between two phones in different buildings or over the internet → Not possible, because the connection relies on physical proximity (Offline-P2P).
Does not need internet at all.
Data Transfer Speed
Texts and small messages: Almost instantaneous (<1 second)
Small images (<1 MB): Approximately 2-3 seconds
Large files (10-20 MB): 10-20 seconds depending on distance and Wi-Fi Direct quality
Important Notes
All devices must be physically close (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi must be enabled).
The app does not use the internet or cellular data at all.
The maximum realistic range is typically from 30 to 100 meters in an open environment without many walls.
Inside homes, 10 to 30 meters is optimal.
Whoever wants the app, message me, and I'll send them the download link.
